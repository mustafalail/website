      <h2 class="fw-light link-body-emphasis mb-1">Improvement of Teaching</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 lead">I firmly believe that student feedback is invaluable for continuous improvement in teaching. I actively solicit and carefully analyze feedback from course evaluations, informal feedback sessions, and individual student meetings. This data-driven approach has been instrumental in refining my teaching methods, course content, and overall classroom environment. I provide the following three examples of how I improved three courses.</p>    
    </div>
     <!-- * Section: Course 1 *-->
    <div>
      <h3 class="fw-light link-body-emphasis mb-1 text-center">Course 1: CSCE 3390 (Software Design/Machine Learning)</h3>
      <h4 class="lead"><b><u>Student Feedback</u></b></h4>
      <p class="lead">Some students have shared with me that the found the lectures to be a bit fast-paced at times, and I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the amount of new material. Additionally, they also have indicated that they would love to see me doing more in-class exercises like they have seen me doing in some other courses. Finally, some students have complained that I am slow in returning their grades on assignments at a time.</p>
      <h4 class="lead"><b><u>Action Taken</u></b></h4>
      <p class="lead">In response to student feedback highlighting that the lecture pace was occasionally too rapid and the need for increased in-class practice, I took decisive action to enhance the learning experience. I intentionally slowed down the lecture pace, allowing for more frequent pauses to address questions and foster class discussions. To reinforce key concepts and facilitate immediate application, I incorporated short quizzes and dynamic group activities throughout the lectures. These changes significantly boosted student engagement and comprehension.</p>
      <p class="lead">Recognizing the critical role of timely feedback, I established a system to provide comprehensive feedback on assignments within a week. This prompt guidance enabled students to swiftly tackle any misconceptions. As a result, students were able to identify and correct errors more effectively, leading to a deeper understanding of the material and improved quality in their assignments.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- * Section: Course 2 *-->
    <div>
      <h3 class="fw-light link-body-emphasis mb-1 text-center">Course 2: CSCE 4201 (Software Engineering)</h3>
      <h4 class="lead"><b><u>Student Feedback</u></b></h4>
      <p class="lead">Student feedback highlighted a desire for more real-world application in the course. Several students expressed a longing for increased opportunities to work on projects that mirrored industry challenges. Additionally, some students expressed concerns regarding project clarity, indicating a need for more precise project requirements and clearly defined deadlines. Finally, a recurring theme in student feedback was a desire for an interaction with industry professionals. Students expressed an interest in learning from the experiences of professionals in the field, gaining insights into real-world applications, and exploring potential career paths.</p>
      <h4 class="lead"><b><u>Action Taken</u></b></h4>
      <p class="lead">Recognizing students' desire for more hands-on experience, I redesigned the course to include a substantial group project that culminated in the development of a complete software application. This approach provided students with a more authentic and engaging learning experience.</p>
      <p class="lead">To address concerns about project clarity, I implemented several enhancements. I provided more detailed project specifications, which included clear timelines, deliverables, and evaluation criteria. Additionally, I established more frequent check-ins with each team to provide timely feedback and guidance, ensuring they stayed on track and could address any emerging challenges.</p>
      <p class="lead">To further enrich the student experience, I invited industry professionals to guest lecture in the class. These guest speakers shared their real-world experiences, offered valuable insights into industry best practices, and provided important career advice.</p>
      <p class="lead">These changes not only responded to specific student feedback but also significantly improved the overall learning experience by giving students a more realistic and industry-relevant perspective on software engineering.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- *Section: Course 3 *-->
    <div>
      <h3 class="fw-light link-body-emphasis mb-1 text-center">Course 3: CSCE 4390 (Computer Engineering Senior Design Project)</h3>
      <h4 class="lead"><b><u>Student Feedback</u></b></h4>
      <p class="lead">Student feedback revealed a need for enhanced project management support. Several students expressed a desire for more guidance on effectively managing their time and resources throughout the project lifecycle. Furthermore, students indicated that they would benefit from more frequent feedback on their project progress to ensure they were on track and address potential challenges proactively. Finally, there was a strong desire for increased interaction with industry professionals. Students expressed a keen interest in presenting their projects to potential employers, gaining valuable feedback, and exploring potential career opportunities.</p>
      <h4 class="lead"><b><u>Action Taken</u></b></h4>
      <p class="lead">Recognizing the importance of effective project management and the need for consistent guidance, I implemented regular project check-ins with each team. These check-ins created a valuable platform for students to discuss their progress, address challenges, and receive personalized support. This frequent interaction helped students stay on track, manage their time effectively, and successfully complete their projects.</p>
      <p class="lead">To enhance the student learning experience further, I also increased the frequency of project presentations. These presentations offered students valuable opportunities to practice their communication and presentation skills, receive constructive feedback from peers and faculty, and build confidence in showcasing their work.</p>
      <p class="lead">Finally, to better prepare students for their future careers, I facilitated connections with potential employers by inviting industry representatives to review student projects. This provided valuable feedback and insights into industry expectations. Exposure to real-world professionals not only enhanced student learning but also created valuable career development opportunities.</p>
      <p class="lead">By actively seeking and incorporating student feedback, I have been able to continuously improve the quality of my teaching and create a more engaging and effective learning experience for all students. This commitment to student-centered learning reflects my dedication to providing the highest quality education and fostering a positive and supportive learning environment.</p>
