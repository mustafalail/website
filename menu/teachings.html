          <p>As educators, professors have two essential duties: delivering quality lectures and facilitating students' learning. Teaching allows me to fulfill one aspect of my mission as I believe students attend universities to learn and become productive society members. My teaching mission is aimed towards:
            Helping students achieve their potential in academia and in the I.T. industry.</p>
          <p>As a professor, I take it upon myself to assist my students in comprehending the fundamental principles of Computer Science/Engineering and their proper application in industrial projects and academic research. I also include exercises that cultivate technical problem-solving abilities and employ current industrial tools and technologies. It is the professors' duty to produce skilled professionals who can develop I.T. systems of varying complexity levels to meet their clients' needs.
            As a professor and student, I have reflected on my experience to develop my pedagogical style. I have also incorporated best practices from teaching training and certificate programs to enhance my style.</p>

        <h2 class="fw-light">Course Evaluation Reflection--Navigating Challenges, Championing Student Success</h2>
        <p class="lead">My commitment to student success is evident in my consistently high course evaluations, which average 4.7, and my proactive approach to addressing systemic challenges and fostering a supportive learning environment. While I am proud of this achievement, I also reflect on the factors that have influenced these scores and the steps I have taken to improve the learning experience for all students continuously.</p>
        <p class="lead">I recognized several unique challenges upon joining TAMIU in the Fall of 2024. At that time, TAMIU only had a minor in Computer Science. This  Computer Science program faced initial low enrollment. It relied on adjunct instructors for lower-level courses, resulting in students arriving in my upper-level classes with varying levels of preparedness. This disparity in foundational knowledge, combined with the rigorous nature of my courses—as confirmed by 90% of my students—created a hurdle for some of them. Additionally, the rapid enrollment growth in the Computer Engineering program, while a sign of its success, increased the demands on my time and resources when the number of faculty stayed relatively unchanged. Lastly, teaching courses outside my specific area of expertise, such as Electronic Devices and Applications, presented its own learning curve.</p>
        <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
          <p class="lead">Rather than accept these challenges, I sought proactive solutions. Recognizing the need for strong foundational instruction, I advocated for the hiring of a dedicated instructional professor to focus on lower-level programming courses. This recommendation has been in effect since Fall 2018. To further bridge the preparation gap, I established a Computer Science tutoring program in partnership with the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE), providing individualized support and mentorship to students. This program has since expanded to benefit Computer Engineering students as well. Additionally, I have dedicated time to mentoring adjunct and visiting assistant professors, sharing my expertise to enhance the quality of instruction in their courses. Finally, I have spearheaded efforts to standardize the curriculum and instructional materials for lower-level programming courses, ensuring greater consistency and quality across all sections.</p>
          <p class="lead">These interventions, implemented over several years, have yielded positive results and demonstrate my commitment to continuous improvement. While the numerical average of my course evaluations provides one measure of my teaching effectiveness, the true impact of my teaching extends far beyond these numbers. As this portfolio demonstrates, I am dedicated to creating a challenging yet supportive learning environment where all students can reach their full potential, regardless of their background or prior preparation. My efforts have significantly impacted my students' lives, preparing them for success in their chosen fields.</p>

        <p class="lead">My unwavering dedication to TAMIU transcends excellence in the classroom and impactful research; I am profoundly committed to leadership and strategic growth within our academic community. Participating in the 2019 Leadership Experience Program provided a vital framework for envisioning my future contributions. I take great pride in my significant progress on my aspirations, particularly with the successful development and implementation of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program—a rigorous curriculum empowering a growing number of students. The attainment of ABET accreditation for this program exemplifies our commitment to quality and rigor, ensuring our graduates are exceptionally prepared for professional practice.</p>
        <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
          <p class="lead">Building on this foundation, my leadership aspirations revolve around enhancing and expanding opportunities for our students and faculty. I envision a future where interdisciplinary collaborations flourish, creating innovative programs that bridge computer science with essential fields such as biology, business, and cybersecurity. These "CS + X" initiatives will equip our graduates with distinctive skill sets that are highly sought after in today's interconnected world. Recognizing the tremendous growth in our computing-related programs, I aspire to lead the charge in establishing a dedicated Department of Computer Science and Engineering. This structural transformation will cultivate a more focused and supportive environment for our faculty and students, fostering greater collaboration and resource allocation. Lastly, I am devoted to developing a Master's degree program in Computer Science and Engineering, providing our talented undergraduates and aspiring professionals in the region with invaluable opportunities for advanced study and research. This endeavor will further elevate TAMIU's academic standing and contribute to the intellectual capital of South Texas. I am eager to join forces with colleagues and university leadership to realize these visions, driven by a passion for innovation and the ongoing success of TAMIU.</p>

        <h2 class="fw-light mb-3">Igniting Innovation: Crafting Custom Programming Languages</h2>
        <p class="lead">In my CSCE 4220 Programming Languages course, I empower students to go beyond mere programming language users and instead become creators. Rather than just studying existing programming languages, students engage deeply in designing and implementing their languages. This course highlights the collaborative, semester-long project in which students, working in teams, develop a functional programming language from scratch. One notable project led to the creation of "DustyDevil," a simple yet expressive language. Building on this foundation, the class then collaboratively enhanced "DustyDevil" to create "DustyDevil++," incorporating advanced features and demonstrating the iterative nature of language development.</p>
        <div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">
          <p class="lead">This hands-on, language-creation project is a rare opportunity for undergraduate students, distinguishing them from their peers at other institutions. While challenging, I believe in our students' potential and providing them with the necessary support and guidance to succeed. Through dedicated mentorship, targeted workshops, and readily available assistance, I equip students with the tools and knowledge to navigate the complexities of language design and implementation.</p>
          <p class="lead">The result is not only a functional programming language but also a profound understanding of language principles, compiler design, and software engineering best practices. This unique experience gives our graduates a competitive edge, making them highly sought-after candidates in industry and graduate programs. The ability to design and implement a programming language demonstrates a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals and a capacity for innovation that is highly valued by employers and graduate admissions committees alike.</p>

The questions asked by the professor kept you engaged in the class, and although at times I answered with uncertainty, the professor always gave a good explanation if I was wrong. I recommend the students to engage with the professor as much as possible since Dr Al Lail is a caring professor who does his best to help you.</p>

It feels rewarding and engaging to be in his classes because you know for a fact that everything he teaches is of value in the class; there are not wasted lectures or content that does not serve a purpose in the class. Also, his assignments build upon these concepts, so it never feels like you were never provided the tools to solve the assignments or complete exams correctly.</p>

During the videos he took us step by step as if we were actually taking the class presently which is something that i enjoyed. Him constantly updating us and reassuring us through emails that we could reach out to him or the SI mentor was something that I enjoyed and it made me feel less nervous about asking questions. The material was hard but we were always motivated to ask questions if there were any which is something I was very thankful for.</p>

Within the first 30 min of the first lesson you are already writing a code, basic though it may have been, but to see a program output what your code told it to made me smile. This course has been hands down my favorite while here at TAMIU. Great Job Professor!!! Another key factor was the response time from the Professor, if you had a question or concern, it was answered within the hour. Great course.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">What I liked the most about this course was the way that the work was organized. Despite the course covering what would normally be covered in three months, I didn't really feel too rushed or anything. I am not a computer science major, so I thought I was going to have a really hard time with the material, but I found the textbook for the class to be really helpful. I am actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the class. I am not saying everything was ridiculously easy, but I did like how it was challenging enough for me. I also really appreciated how understanding Dr. Al Lail was when it came to the extension of some due dates. He also replied fairly fast whenever I had a question, and I really appreciate it since this was an online class.</p>
