      <p class="mt-3 lead">Participating in service activities is a crucial responsibility for faculty members as it plays a significant role in the academic triad, alongside teaching and research. It directly impacts the quality of education students receive. Since I arrived at TAMIU, I have enthusiastically engaged in multiple voluntary and citizenship initiatives. I will now elaborate on these activities in the following sections.</p>

I have shared my experience with others through presentations and workshops.</p>
      <p class="lead">I established and have been advising the Computer Science & Engineering Association (CSEA) at Texas A&M International University since Fall 2019. The club aims to build and sustain a community of students at TAMIU who are interested in computer science and engineering.</p>
      <p class="lead">In Fall 2019, I established a new Computer Science tutoring program with the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) at TAMIU. This program aims to support education by providing students individualized tutoring and mentoring through instruction leaders and tutors. Since then, Computer Engineering faculty have used the same service to improve instruction and help struggling students.</p>

      <p class="lead">My commitment to academic excellence extends beyond my current accomplishments. In my 2019 Leadership Experience Program statement, I outlined seven aspirations for my professional development at TAMIU. I am pleased to report that I have already made significant progress towards achieving two of these goals: the successful development and implementation of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program and the attainment of ABET accreditation for this program.</p>
      <p class="lead">My next set of goals focuses on expanding the academic offerings within the department, including the creation of interdisciplinary computer science programs, such as "Computer Science + [X]" where "X" represents another field like biology, business, or cybersecurity. Furthermore, I envision the establishment of a dedicated Department of Computer Science and Engineering to better support our growing programs and faculty. Finally, I aspire to develop a graduate program in Computer Science and Engineering, providing advanced educational opportunities for our students. I am confident that these goals will be achieved within the next five years through continued collaboration, innovation, and dedication to academic excellence.</p>
